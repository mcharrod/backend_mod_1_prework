## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I already have a growth mindset and do a lot of reading, I see certain aspects of myself as malleable and able to be improved upon with practice. One thing I struggle with is teaching others what I've learned, and knowing to take breaks early and often.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

puts "Hello World!" (print or p would also work)

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

# ( a hashtag )

1. Explain the difference between
an integer and a float?

an integer is a whole number whereas a float has a decimal point.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

animal = "Zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

puts animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

interpolation is adding in a separate equation into a string. To put the variable Zebra into a string, you'd do

"When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not #{animal}."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

gets

you can do gets.chomp if you want the answer written in the same line as the next print.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

1. Get the length of a string
2. reverse a string
