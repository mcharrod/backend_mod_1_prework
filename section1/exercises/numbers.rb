# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/numbers.rb`

# Example: Write code that prints the result of the sum of 2 and 2:
p 2 + 2

puts "what is 2 plus 2? #{ 2 + 2 }"

# Write code that prints the result of 7 subtracted from 83:
p "Now I will subtract 7 from 83! #{ 83 - 7 }"

# Write code that prints the result of 6 multiplied by 53:
p 6 * 53

# Write code that prints the result of the modulo of 10 into 54:
print "what is 54 % 10?"

p 54 % 10
#definitely need some further clarification on what this thing does!!! I would
#have anticipated the answer to be at least 5, not 4...
