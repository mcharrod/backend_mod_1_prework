# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/numbers.rb`
def new_line
  puts "\n"
end

# Example: Write code that prints the result of the sum of 2 and 2:
new_line
puts "what is 2 plus 2? #{ 2 + 2 }"

# Write code that prints the result of 7 subtracted from 83:
new_line
puts "what is 83 minus 7? #{ 83 - 7 }"

# Write code that prints the result of 6 multiplied by 53:
new_line
puts "What is 6 times 53? #{6 * 53}"

# Write code that prints the result of the modulo of 10 into 54:
new_line
puts "the remainder for 54 / 10 is #{54 % 10}"

# so I guess the % puts the second number into the first and returns
# the remainder
