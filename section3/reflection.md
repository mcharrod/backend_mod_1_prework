## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I really appreciated hearing that it's better to look at how far you have come instead of comparing to others, and is definitely
something I need to get better at. Also that nobody is born an incredible coder, it is a long process spent being a beginner.
A lot of the stuff mentioned in the growth mindset blog post and video seems like it should be well known, but I still sometimes
struggle to have this mindset and the reminder is useful.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I think I demonstrate a growth mindset in the way that I am constantly striving for things just
outside of my current skills, and understand that learning is a process rather than something
some people will naturally be good at. One way I do this is by reading a lot of books
on how to get better at specific skills. One of my recent favorites? "The Power of Habit"!

In some ways I do struggle with the growth mindset, sometimes challenging myself to learn can
be hard. It's more comfortable to stick with what you already know. I can also get down on myself
by comparing myself to unrealistic standards.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash can hold multiple key = value pairs. An array is just an indexed list of things.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {
  "Large dog leashes" => 8,
  "Medium dog leashes" => 14,
  "Small dog leashes" => 6,
  "dog kibble" => 8,
  "cat kibble" => 6,
  "doggles" => 3,
  "fish tank decorations" => 50
}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

states.keys
states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

a school's data on student's initials and full names. A hash would be better so you can match the initials and names, and
have them separate instead of requiring the two pieces to be mixed in one.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

how would you put a hash inside of a hash?
